# Typicode JSON

The aim of this project was to practice AJAX, so I created a website with posts from users. This project fetches data from {JSON} Placeholder - GET request was performed. The layout of the website was inspired by Facebook and Twitter.

## The website could be separated into three parts (pages):

- home page - posts by all users are displayed
- user search - a list of users that can be searched through or sorted alphabetically
- user's profile - whenever any of user's avatar or name is clicked on, selected user's profile will be shown

## Tech stack (libraries) used:

- React JS
- Axios
- Lodash
